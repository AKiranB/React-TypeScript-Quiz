React-TypeScript-Quiz is an application that allows users to answer questions and test their knowledge in a category with a level of difficulty of their choosing. This project is built with React, TypeScript and Chakra UI and uses the Open Trivia API to source questions. I started this project to get my hands dirty with Typescript and hone my skills in frontend development with React.

If you'd like to check this project out in your environment:{

1: clone it to your local environment => npm i in root-folder,
2: npm start in root => runs on localhost:3000

}
